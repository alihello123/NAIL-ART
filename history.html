              The history of nail art dates back to as early as 3000 B.C. when the ancient Egyptians were 
              known for decorating their nails with henna. Not only did they adorn their hands and feet, 
              but would also add designs and pictures of nature such as flowers, animals, and plants. It's
              fair to say that things have moved on somewhat in the last 5,000 years or so. But the principles
              remain the same. People want to adorn their bodies and make their nails more vibrant and colourful.
              In this piece, we'll explore the history of nail art from the ancient world to the modern-day world of acrylics and gel polish

            <p> <br><br><br><br> <i> For centuries, the ancient Egyptians have cherished henna as more than just a beautiful decoration.
              Considered to be a powerful natural supplement, they believed that it could help stimulate healthy hair and nail growth 
              in addition to its many medicinal benefits. Its vibrant colours quickly became popular among dancers and royalty who used
              it to adorn their hands with elaborate designs for long-lasting elegance. The use of henna also spread to the Middle East
              and India, where it remains popular to this day.

            <p> <br><br><br><br> <i>Meanwhile, in China, the growing (and painting) of nails were considered to be a 
              symbol of wealth and status. As many of us will know if nails are too long manual tasks can become more
               tricky to perform. So the wealthy class would keep their nails shorter and paint their vivid colours to 
               show off their status.
              With the invention of nail polish in the 16th century, trends quickly evolved to include not just colour 
              but ornate patterns as well. In France during this period, women would often add elaborate designs featuring 
              swirls and other abstract shapes to their nails, while in 19th-century Britain they went for more subtle designs,
               often preferring to use plain colours such as pinks and yellows
